    You may assume that the input word is always either a string of letters,

    lowercase letters, so you will have to handle uppercase and mixed case strings 
    appropriately. 

	The score for a word is the product of two components:

	The first component is the sum of the points for letters in the word.
	The second component is the larger of:
            1, or
            7*wordlen - 3*(n-wordlen), where wordlen is the length of the word
            and n is the hand length when the word was played

	Letters are scored as in Scrabble; A is worth 1, B is
	worth 3, C is worth 3, D is worth 2, E is worth 1, and so on.
