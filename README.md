# MIT6.0001
## Course information
* **Course title:** MIT 6.0001 Introduction to Computer Science and Programming in Python
* I attended this course on MIT ocw in March and April 2020. Before taking this course, I self-studied Python by reading online documentations. But I still found it very useful as it is systemmatic and goes through stuff at a good pace (I found most other basic Python online courses far too slow, but that's probably because I have some programming experience back in childhood). Also, the problem sets are good enough to give me the opportunity to really get familiar with the syntax.
* [This is the course website.](https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/electrical-engineering-and-computer-science/6-0001-introduction-to-computer-science-and-programming-in-python-fall-2016/) Here, you can find all the course resources, including lecture videos, lecture slides and code, assignments, syllabus etc.
## About this reponsitory
This repository contains the following:

* [My personal notes on the course](https://github.com/vaccineaftsex/MIT6.0001/tree/master/My%20notes)
  * the "python basics" file includes not only the course contents, but also (largely) my notes on phython official documentations.
* [My attempt on the problem sets (all tested)](https://github.com/vaccineaftsex/MIT6.0001/tree/master/assignments)
  * ps0 and ps2 were not attempted because I anticipated no problem with them
  * Noted that when I run ps5 on my computer, it did not work. Problems occured in the helper code provided by the course instructor, and I had no idea how to resolve them at this stage. However, the parts that I was supposed to do as assignments passed through unit testing.
