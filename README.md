MIT 6.0001 Introduction to Computer Science and Programming in Python

* I attended this course on MIT ocw in March and April 2020.

* [This is the course website.](https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/electrical-engineering-and-computer-science/6-0001-introduction-to-computer-science-and-programming-in-python-fall-2016/) Here, you can find all the resources, including lecture videos, lecture slides and code, assignments, syllabus etc.

* This repository contains the following:
  * [Lecture slides and code (downloaded from website without change)](https://github.com/vaccineaftsex/MIT6.0001/tree/master/lecture-slides-code)
  * [My personal notes on the course](https://github.com/vaccineaftsex/MIT6.0001/tree/master/My%20notes)
    * the "python basics" file includes not only the course content, but also (largely) my notes on phython official documentations.
  * [My attempt on the problem sets (all tested)](https://github.com/vaccineaftsex/MIT6.0001/tree/master/assignments)
    * ps0 and ps2 not attempted because I anticipate no problem with them
    * Noted that when I run ps5 on my computer, it does not work. Problems occur in the helper code provided by the course, and I have no idea how to resolve them at this stage. However, the parts that I am supposed to do as assignments passed through unit testing.
